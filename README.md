I am a Full Stack Developer and a recent Flatiron School graduate. I am experienced with JavaScript technologies/tools (npm, yarn, built-in functions, fetch) and frameworks (React.js/Redux). My back-end experience is with Ruby Rails. I also have had a little experience with cloud services like Heroku/Netlify to deploy apps, and AWS to spin up a EC2 service to run an Linux distro (Ubuntu). I have had light experience with data and machine learning by utilizing Tensorflow.js models but am excited to be able to learn and work with more technologies/languages.

Some of my projects are listed in my [portofolio][5].
