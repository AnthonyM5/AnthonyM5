I'm an experienced web developer with a background in e-commerce (analyst, admin) and strong background working in web and mobile applications.  I specialize in developing user-centric design and work with modern JavaScript (TypeScript) frameworks like React/Angular to create effective and accessible solutions for the web.  I'm a self taught developer who's passionate about continued learning and building impactful products that unlocks value for the end consumer.  I have proven experience working cross-functionally in Agile environments to help deliver high quality results across multiple industries ranging from education to multi-billion dollar B2B platforms.  As someone who is passionate about learning and tackling challenges I'm always looking for the next opportunity to work with world class teams.
