As a Frontend Engineer with over three years of consulting experience at Accenture Song, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to design and deliver scalable, high-performance applications across industries including education, e-commerce, and banking. My work has spanned modern frameworks like Angular with NgRX and React.js, where Iâ€™ve led frontend architecture efforts, implemented advanced state management strategies, and developed real-time features using tools like Socket.io and Redis. Iâ€™ve maintained and contributed to multiple internal libraries across enterprise codebases using modular architectures and Nx monorepos, ensuring reusability and maintainability at scale. Whether integrating analytics with RxJS and Google Analytics, configuring secure DNS deployments, or resolving high-priority production issues, I bring a solutions-driven mindset and a strong commitment to shipping clean, impactful code. I thrive in cross-functional, Agile teams where collaboration and technical ownership go hand-in-hand.

Some of my projects are listed in my [portfolio][4].
